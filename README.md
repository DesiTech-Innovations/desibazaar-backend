*   **COGS Calculation**: Implemented Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) calculation using FIFO method based on actual purchase costs from purchase orders, providing accurate profit analysis.

*   **Corrected Net Profit**: Net profit is now calculated as: `Total Sales - COGS - Operational Expenses` (excludes inventory purchases).

*   **Outstanding Receivables**: Added proper calculation of outstanding receivables as `Total Sales - Total Paid`.

*   **Enhanced Reports**: All financial reports now include COGS, corrected net profit calculations, profit margins, and clear field descriptions in API documentation.

*   **Stock Movement Tracking**: Complete audit trail for all inventory operations with timestamps, reasons, and references.

#### Important Notes

*   **Operational Expenses**: Only true business operational costs should be recorded in the expense module.
*   **Backward Compatibility**: Existing data remains unaffected; validation applies only to new expense entries.

#### API Changes

*   **Enhanced Expense Management**: Expense creation/update endpoints now validate expense types
*   **New Stock Management Endpoints**: 
  *   `GET /api/stock/movements/{itemVariantId}` - Stock movement history
  *   `GET /api/stock/movements` - Movement reports by date range
  *   `GET /api/stock/low-stock-alerts` - Low stock alerts
  *   `POST /api/stock/adjust` - Manual stock adjustments

*   **Enhanced Report Endpoints**: Return additional fields: `totalCOGS`, corrected `netProfit`, `grossMargin`, and `outstandingReceivable`
*   **Comprehensive API Documentation**: Enhanced Swagger documentation explains all new features and the distinction between different financial metrics

### COGS Calculation Methodology

The system uses **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** method for Cost of Goods Sold calculation:

1. **Stock Entry**: Each stock addition records the actual cost per unit from purchase orders
2. **Sale Processing**: When items are sold, the system calculates COGS by consuming stock entries in chronological order (oldest first)
3. **Profit Calculation**: Gross Profit = Sales Revenue - COGS, with margin percentages automatically calculated
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete stock movement history maintains accurate cost tracking for compliance and analysis

This methodology ensures accurate profit reporting and provides valuable business insights for pricing and inventory management decisions.
